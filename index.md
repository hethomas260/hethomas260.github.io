### Python

I recently completed the CFG Introduction to Python course.   I already knew a fair bit of Python from my research days, but it was great to learn in a more structured way, as everything previously I had self taught by need.  Getting exposure to APIs and how Python can be used to interact with them, as well as the huge range of free APIs available was great.  

### Github

Just starting on Github now as it makes sense to keep things organised.
